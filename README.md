# An OpenFOAM solver focused on free-running maneuvering simulations - CustomHOSource 

### Summary

This is a branch of the original Balabibo code. I added code and readmes to try to make it more clear. The idea is to add more code needed to do my own projects but i think they can be useful for anyone doing self propulsion simulations in OpenFOAM.

I'll add more tutorials and further simulations to verify the code. 

The actuator disk code HOSource was tested against Marin, Schottel and Kongsberg data and so far it looks promising. Achieving 0.6% relative error for propulsion tests of a ship in Marin. 

A clone of the original Turning-35 tutorial has been added. This is basically the original with small tweeks so that it works flawlesly.
